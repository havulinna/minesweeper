        <h1>Minesweeper demo application</h1>

        <p>
            This is a demo application written in Java using the Spring
            MVC framework. The application is focused on demonstrating the
            design and implementation of a generic Java application running
            on the back-end.
        </p>
        <p>
            As this is more of a technology demo than a polished
            entertainment product, do not expect too much from the user
            experience.
        </p>
